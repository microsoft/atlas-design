Test PR Creation from Agent

This file was created as part of a test to demonstrate automated PR creation capabilities. 

The goal of this test is to:
- Create a basic text file in the repository
- Validate that an AI agent can successfully contribute to the codebase
- Demonstrate minimal, focused changes that don't disrupt existing functionality

This is a simple test file that serves as a proof of concept for agent-driven development workflows.
