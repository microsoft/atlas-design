# Contribution Guidelines for Engineering

This post provides some contribution guidelines for CSS/Scss in Atlas.

## When making a code change

- be careful and purposeful.
- test your code change locally using the site.
- ask yourself, does this change need to be documented?
  - if so, and the change is to our styles, please ensure that you make a documentation change in the same pull request.
  - if so, and the change is to our development environment, please make sure the appropriate readme file is updated/created.
- fill out a **changeset** using the [changeset cli](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/main/docs/intro-to-using-changesets.md).
  - if the change is to styles (`/css`) or scripts (`/js`), you must fill out a changeset.
  - `npx changeset add` will get you started.
  - if the change is to the site's infrastructure, you should fill out a changeset. _Note: we do not need semver for the site, but changesets will also provide a nicely organized changelog for improvements across the site._
  - semver primer -> major = "breaking change", minor = "new functionality," patch = "fix" to existing functionality.
- make a pull request and whenever possible...
  - include a work item number.
  - include a preview link to PR version of the site for easier functional reviewing of your code. (`preview-<pr-number>` or `<origin>/pulls/<pr-number>/path/to/page/`).
- avoid making breaking changes, unless you really, really have to.
- if you don't know what might constitute a breaking change ask a team member or start a discussion.
- checkout the readme of the folder you're working in. Each folder should have a readme detailing the purpose of the folder and guidelines for contributing.

## When writing new Scss

- ensure signoff from the design systems team has been reached before you begin work.
- not sure if signoff has been reached? Ask in a new/existing discussion!

## When updating existing Scss

- try using [`npm link`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-link) to view the impact on existing systems that import Atlas.

## Enable the Changeset bot with a fine-grain PAT

The changeset bot needs some permissions in order to access our repo to help us with releases. If the release action begins to fail, it may be due to an expired token.

1. In Github, go to your settings
1. Go to Developer Settings
1. Select Personal Access Tokens, and Fine-grained tokens
1. Note! You can just click "Regenerate token" if you have an existing one already.
1. Name the token something like "changeset-bot-token-[createdate]", where [createdate] follows the following format: "12-31-2023" as represents the date you made this token.
1. Changesets requires the following permissions:
   - Read access to actions variables, metadata, and secrets
   - Read and Write access to actions, code, discussions, and pull requests
1. Select a date for its expiration.
1. Submit form.
1. Copy value of token. It will looks something like `github_pat_*********************************`
1. Got to Atlas settings, Secrets, Actions.
1. Edit value of "RELEASE_GITHUB" with value of created token.
1. Save.
