Update popover to add options for dynamic positioning on the page, vertically and horizontally. Maintains fixed position capabilities as well. Add a caret class to show a small caret pointing towards the popover button. Adds functionality to scroll the page if the contents inside the popover exceed the page height but can be scrolled into view.
