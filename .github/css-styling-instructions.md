# Basic CSS Styling Instructions

- Use semantic class names that describe the purpose of the style.
- Prefer utility classes for common properties (e.g., margin, padding, color).
- Keep selectors simple and avoid high specificity.
- Use variables for colors, spacing, and typography for consistency.
- Organize styles by component or atomic category.
- Document any custom or complex styles with comments.
