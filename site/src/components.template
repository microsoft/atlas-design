# Page title (component name)

The first thing is the general description.

Consider using tables to organize information if there are a lot of nuances.

| State       | Class                  | Example        |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | -------------- |
| `<name>`    | `<value>`              | html```Demo``` |

## Usage

Provide a focused example that displays this component's usage.

```html
<div>
  <button class="button">Click me</button>
</div>
```

### Modifier heading

If there are components variations available such as different semantic colors, sizes, loading states, etc., the next section(s) should be about them.

```html
<div class="notification is-loading">
    <p>Loading notification.</p>
</div>
```
