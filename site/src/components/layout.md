# Layout

The layout component provides a flexible and efficient way to structure the major containers of web pages.

## Try layouts here

This page is utilizing the holy grail layout, but you can use the buttons below to toggle layouts and test them out by resizing the screen. Try the "Toggle container labels" button below to see the css classes on each of the containers inside `.layout`.

<div class="buttons buttons-addons margin-top-sm display-flex">
  <button class="button" data-set-layout="layout-holy-grail" aria-pressed="true">Holy grail</button>
  <button class="button" data-set-layout="layout-twin">Twin</button>
  <button class="button" data-set-layout="layout-single">Single</button>
  <button class="button" data-set-layout="layout-sidecar-left">Sidecar left</button>
  <button class="button" data-set-layout="layout-sidecar-right">Sidecar right</button>
</div>
<div class="buttons buttons-addons display-flex">
	<button class="button" data-toggle-debug aria-pressed="false">Toggle container labels</button>
	<button class="button" data-toggle-layout-height-constraint aria-pressed="false">Constrain layout height</button>
</div>
<div class="buttons buttons-addons display-flex">
	<button class="button button-filled" data-toggle-hero-visibility aria-pressed="true">Toggle hero</button>
	<button class="button button-filled" data-toggle-footer-visibility aria-pressed="true">Toggle footer</button>
	<button class="button" data-toggle-flyout-visibility aria-pressed="false">Toggle flyout</button>
</div>

## Important concepts

Thankfully, no one needs to be expert to use the `.layout` element. But it does help to understand a few important concepts before beginning.

### Markup structure

The `.layout` class is designed to be placed on the `<html>` element itself, while the `layout-body` element is designed to be placed on the `<body>` element. All other elements are children of `layout-body`. Specific layouts are applied by adding a class with the format `layout-{nameoflayout}` to the `html.layout` element.

Nearly all layouts have the same eight elements, and the `layout-body-hero` element is always optional. While the `layout`, `layout-body`, `layout-body-header`, `layout-body-footer`, and `layout-body-main` elements are always required. The behavior of `layout-body-menu` and `layout-body-aside` depend on the layout.

The basic boilerplate for a layout is as follows:

```html-no-example
<html class="layout layout-{nameoflayout}">
	<body class="layout-body">
		<header style="layout-body-header">Header</header>
		<section aria-label="hero" class="layout-body-hero">Hero</section>
		<nav class="layout-body-menu">Menu</nav>
		<main class="layout-body-main">Main</main>
		<aside class="layout-body-aside">Aside</aside>
		<footer class="layout-body-footer">Footer</footer>
	</body>
</html>
```

### Apply your own spacing

The `$layout-gap` token is used to generate two separate classes that can be used to apply spacing to containers _within_ each of the major layout areas. Spacing should _not_ be applied to the `layout-body-*` containers themselves, but rather to elements within them - most often a single container that is a direct child of the `layout-body-*` element.

| Class name        | Use case                             | Examples of use case                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.layout-padding` | Layout areas that are not full width | The menu and aside areas. The main area when not in a single layout                   |
| `.layout-margin`  | Full width layout areas              | The header, footer, and hero. The main area when it is full width in a single layout. |

Why not use gap? You certainly can apply any [gap atomics](../atomics/gap.md) to the `layout-body` to change spacing as you see fit. However, to provide adequate space to display focus rectangles and to ensure enough space to render dynamic inline elements (like heading anchors), spacing applied to an inner container is still the best choice.

### Responsiveness

The layout components behavior is inextricably bound to Atlas's breakpoints. On narrow widths on all layouts, elements are stacked on top of one another. If you don't want an element to show on a particular screensize, you should either render nothing into it or hide the inner element.

## Available layouts

There are two available layouts.

- [`layout-single`](#layout-single)
- [`layout-holy-grail`](#holy-grail-layout)
- [`layout-sidecar-left`](#sidecar-left-layout)
- [`layout-sidecar-right`](#sidecar-right-layout)
- [`layout-twin`](#twin-layout)

### Layout Single

The `layout-single` class provides a simple stacked layout. It is equivalent to a series of marginless and paddingless stacked block level elements. All elements in a single layout should set their own margin somewhere within their nested containers. Most likely, you'll want to apply `.layout-margin` or some other container-like class to elements within the single layout. This is also the default layout that will render if no other class is provide.

How do I apply it? `layout-single` to the `layout` element.

Required elements: all except `layout-body-hero`.

Allowed elements: all.

Can have its height constrained? No.

```Text
   Narrow
  ┌────────────┐
  │ Header     │
  ├────────────┤
  │ Hero       │
  ├────────────┤
  │ Menu       │
  ├────────────┤
  │ Main       │
  ├────────────┤
  │ Aside      │
  ├────────────┤
  │ Footer     │
  └────────────┘
```

The specification for this layout is as follows.

| Screensize          | Behavior                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Narrow - Widescreen | All elements are stacked. |

### Holy Grail layout

Named after a layout that [historically was difficult to implement](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_grail_(web_design)>) the holy grail is stacked on narrow widths and progressively shows up to three columns as the screen widens.

How do I apply it? `layout-holy-grail` to the `layout` element.

Required elements: all except `layout-body-hero`.

Allowed elements: all.

Can have its height constrained? Yes, on desktop screens and wider. This differs from other constrainable layouts, because on tablet aside wraps under main, preventing us from constraining main's height effectively.

The following block is arranged from narrow widths on the left to wider widths on the right.

```Text
   Narrow         Tablet           Widescreen
  ┌────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────────────┐
  │ Header     │ │Header        │ │ Header               │
  ├────────────┤ ├──────────────┤ ├──────────────────────┤
  │ Hero       │ │Hero          │ │ Hero                 │
  ├────────────┤ ├─────┬────────┤ ├─────┬────────┬───────┤
  │ Menu       │ │Menu │ Main   │ │Menu │ Main   │ Aside │
  ├────────────┤ │     │        │ │     │        │       │
  │ Main       │ │     │        │ │     │        │       │
  ├────────────┤ │     ├────────┤ │     │        │       │
  │ Aside      │ │     │ Aside  │ │     │        │       │
  ├────────────┤ ├─────┴────────┤ ├─────┴────────┴───────┤
  │ Footer     │ │Footer        │ │ Footer               │
  └────────────┘ └──────────────┘ └──────────────────────┘
```

The specification for this layout is as follows.

| Screensize | Behavior                                                                                                                      |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Narrow     | All elements are stacked.                                                                                                     |
| Tablet     | Menu and main are side by side. Main is wider than menu. Aside has a collapsed height and is tucked under main.               |
| Desktop    | Menu, main, aside are side by side. Main is wider than menu.                                                                  |
| Widescreen | Same as desktop with scaling gutter that keeps combined width of menu, main, aside to the width of the widescreen breakpoint. |

### Sidecar left layout

A "sidecar" is a smaller companion container that sits beside the main content container on tablet screens and wider. In `layout-sidecar-left` the sidecar refers to the `layout-body-menu` element, which sits to the left of `layout-body-main`. Unlike other layouts, this layout does not allow the usage of the `layout-body-aside` containers.

How do I apply it? `layout-sidecar-left` to the `layout` element.

Required elements: all except `layout-body-hero` and `layout-body-aside` (see allowed elements).

Allowed elements: all except `layout-body-aside`.

Can have its height constrained? Yes, on tablet screens and wider.

The following block is arranged from narrow widths on the left to wider widths on the right.

```txt
   Narrow           Tablet           Widescreen
  ┌────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────────────┐
  │ Header     │   │Header        │ │ Header               │
  ├────────────┤   ├──────────────┤ ├──────────────────────┤
  │ Hero       │   │Hero          │ │ Hero                 │
  ├────────────┤   ├─────┬────────┤ ├──────┬───────────────┤
  │ Menu       │   │Menu │ Main   │ │ Menu │ Main          │
  ├────────────┤   │     │        │ │      │               │
  │ Main       │   │     │        │ │      │               │
  │            │   │     │        │ │      │               │
  │            │   │     │        │ │      │               │
  ├────────────┤   ├─────┴────────┤ ├──────┴───────────────┤
  │ Footer     │   │Footer        │ │ Footer               │
  └────────────┘   └──────────────┘ └──────────────────────┘
```

The specification for this layout is as follows.

| Screensize       | Behavior                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Narrow           | All elements are stacked.                                                                                                        |
| Tablet - desktop | Menu and main are side by side. Main is wider than menu.                                                                         |
| Widescreen       | Same as tablet-desktop with scaling gutter that keeps combined width of menu and main to the width of the widescreen breakpoint. |

### Sidecar right layout

The "sidecar" remains as defined in the section above, but in `layout-sidecar-right` the sidecar refers to the `layout-body-aside` element, which sits to the right of `layout-body-main` on tablet screens and wider. Unlike other layouts, this layout does not allow the usage of the `layout-body-menu` containers.

How do I apply it? `layout-sidecar-right` to the `layout` element.

Required elements: all except `layout-body-hero` and `layout-body-menu` (see allowed elements).

Allowed elements: all except `layout-body-menu`.

Can have its height constrained? Yes, on tablet screens and wider.

The following block is arranged from narrow widths on the left to wider widths on the right.

```txt
  Narrow           Tablet                   Widescreen
 ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────────────┐ ┌──────────────────────┐
 │Header        │ │ Header               │ │ Header               │
 ├──────────────┤ ├──────────────────────┤ ├──────────────────────┤
 │Hero          │ │ Hero                 │ │ Hero                 │

```

The specification for this layout is as follows.

| Screensize       | Behavior                                                                                                                          |

| Narrow           | All elements are stacked.                                                                                                         |
| Tablet - desktop | Main and aside are side by side. Main is wider than aside.                                                                        |
| Widescreen       | Same as tablet-desktop with scaling gutter that keeps combined width of main and aside to the width of the widescreen breakpoint. |

### Twin layout

On tablet screens and large the twin layout allows two containers (`main` and `aside`) to share the central part of the screen. Unlike some of the other containers these two containers continue to grow beyond the boundaries of the widescreen breakpoint. This means the text-based content rendered in either should consider setting a maximum width to ensure readability. This layout is ideal for a side-by-side experience, where a user might read an article in `main` and perform some interactive task, such as editing code, in `aside`.

How do I apply it? `layout-twin` to the `layout` element.

Required elements: all except `layout-body-hero` and `layout-body-menu` (see allowed elements).

Allowed elements: all except `layout-body-menu`.

Can have its height constrained? Yes, on tablet screens and wider.

The following block is arranged from narrow widths on the left to wider widths on the right.

```txt
  Narrow           Tablet and wider
 ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────────────┐
 │Header        │ │ Header               │
 ├──────────────┤ ├──────────────────────┤
 │Hero          │ │ Hero                 │
 ├──────────────┤ ├───────────┬──────────┤
 │Main          │ │ Main      │     Aside│
 │              │ │           │          │
 │              │ │           │          │
 ├──────────────┤ │           │          │
 │Aside         │ │           │          │
 ├──────────────┤ ├───────────┴───-──────┤
 │Footer        │ │ Footer               │
 └──────────────┘ └──────────────────────┘
```

The specification for this layout is as follows.

| Screensize       | Behavior                                                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Narrow           | All elements are stacked.                                          |
| Tablet and wider | Main and aside are side by side. Main and aside are the same width |

## Layouts with individually scrolling content containers

If you'd like central containers to scroll individually, instead of the page itself, you have to constrain the height of the layout to the viewport. In order to do that, you can add the `.layout-constrained` class to the `html.layout` element. This has no effect on narrow screens or on the `single` layout, but will work on most other layouts on tablet and larger (the exception being holy grail, which kicks in on desktop widths). See each layout's individual section for behavior specific to it.

This requires the use of some very lightweight client JavaScript to updates a few values on the HTML element as the screen resizes. This means you must install `@microsoft/atlas-js` and import and call the `initLayout` in your client scripts for this behavior to work. See [how this site does it on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/atlas-design/blob/main/site/src/scaffold/index.ts).

### How does constraint work?

When constraint is active the height of the page is calculated to be 100vh (i.e. the size of the viewport) _plus the size of the hero._ This means:

1. Main (and any container horizontally adjacent to it) will have a height equal to the viewport height minus the footer's height and the header's height.
1. Developers must still consider narrow views first. This behavior does not change scroll on narrow screens or mobile devices.
1. Consider also whether to omit footer or move footer into a different container for a more perfect full-screen fit.

### Why is hero excluded from height calculation?

1. The hero is full width and never side by side with another container. It needn't be scrolled individually and what's more doing so would be quite an odd behavior.
1. Including it will not harm the experience, but it isn't recommended when using height constraints.
1. Users will have to scroll past hero to get to the content containers. If you do include it, ensure it isn't too tall.
1. Remember, the hero is always optional.

## An optional flyout container

A flyout is a container that appears on the side of the screen. It provides additional space to render elements that you may not always want to be visible. Atlas's optional flyout container can be added to any layout. This container has several important characteristics:

1. **It is not available on narrow and tablet-size screens.** There simply isn't room for it. This means that whatever content is available in this sidebar, should be rendered elsewhere on narrow/tablet screen sizes. Typically, this would be done in a modal that renders "on top" of the other containers. Atlas does not implement this for you.
1. The flyout can be shown/hidden by adding/removing the `.layout-flyout-active` class to the `.layout` element.
1. The default widths of the flyout on both desktop and widescreen can be customized with the following CSS variables.
   1. `--layout-flyout-width-desktop` will affect the desktop breakpoint.
   1. `--layout-flyout-width-widescreen` will affect the widescreen (largest) breakpoint.
1. This means developers must handle mobile and tablet widths with a different solution, such using a modal on narrow screens.
1. On expand/collapse of the flyout, it's recommended developers perform manual focus handling to ensure that focus is not lost for screenreaders.
1. The same should happen on resize.

## Accessibility Concerns

### ARIA landmarks

Due to the [recommendation that all content be rendering into ARIA landmark regions](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.7/region), the hero element should be a `<section>` element with an unique aria-label (or aria-labelled by).

### DOM order should reflect visual hierarchy

Grid areas, the CSS feature powering the layout component, have the potential to make DOM order different from visual hierarchy (i.e. which element seems like it is first on the page). This can cause confusion for keyboard users who use <kbd>tab</kbd> to navigate through web pages. The recommended order of elements within `layout-body` is as follows:

1. Header
1. Hero (if present)
1. Menu (if present)
1. Main
1. Aside (if present)
1. Footer

See WCAG on [Making the DOM order match the visual order](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C27.html) for more information on this topic.

## Advanced topic - switching layouts on the fly

Because layouts generally contain the same elements and because the current layout is determined by a singular class on the `.layout` element, changing layout is as easy as swapping out a class.

```JavaScript
document.documentElement.classList.remove('layout-single');
document.documentElement.classList.add('layout-holy-grail');
```

You'll seldom have occasion to do this in the middle of a user's visit, but it can be useful for things like opening a code editor in a wider layout or adopting a focused reading mode.
