# Thread History

The thread history pattern

```html
<div class="display-flex border-md padding-block-sm padding-inline-md">
	<ul>
		<li class="line line-solid">
			<div class="thread-icon"></div>
			<div class="thread-text">
				<div class="thread-title">
					<p>Start from Shire</p>
					<p class="thread-timestamp">3rd March 2015 19:00</p>
				</div>
				<div class="thread-detail">
					In summary, the Shire is a land of beauty, tranquility, and simple pleasures. It is a
					place where the worries of the world seem to fade away, and one can truly appreciate the
					joys of a peaceful and contented life. Whether you are strolling through the verdant
					fields, enjoying a meal with friends, or simply basking in the natural beauty of the
					landscape, the Shire offers a sense of serenity and happiness that is unmatched anywhere
					else in Middle-earth.
