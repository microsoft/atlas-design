# Atlas Design System

Welcome to the Atlas Design project! This repository holds the source code backing the Atlas Design System.

## Our mission

The Atlas Design System strives to empower designers, PMs, and developers to build accessible, high quality, and consistent experiences at scale across the Microsoft Skilling web properties. Atlas powers [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com) ðŸ¤“!

Looking for information about the Atlas CSS framework? Start in `/css`!

## What we do

- We care deeply about accessibility. Microsoft Learn is one of the very few large Grade B websites.
- We are a low-level design system that focuses on CSS and only uses zero-dependency JS when required for good interactions or accessibility.
- We are compatible with right-to-left reading direction thanks to our use of logical properties.
- We are themeable, with three themes right out of the box (Light, Dark, and High Contrast), and we support an unlimited number of themes.
- We provide example markup. Our website is spartan compared to many design system websites. Its main purpose is for atomic/component documentation and to provide accessible code snippets.
- We have atomics for flexibility and components for consistency.
- We have a VSCode extension that provides helpful IntelliSense and class completion in the IDE.
- We publish to NPM.

## Development

- Ensure [git](https://git-scm.com/) is installed.
- Ensure that have downloaded and installed a version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) that supports monorepos. It's currently recommended you download NodeJS version 18.12.1 and use with NPM at a greater version than 8.19.2.
- Alternatively, you can install NPM with NVM: [mac](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) | [windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).
- If contributing code, please read about using [changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) and [semantic versioning bump types](https://semver.org/).
- Clone the repostory.
- From the root directory, run `npm install`.

## Using Atlas CSS

The styles backing the Atlas Design system are discussed in greater detail in `/css`.

### Install Atlas CSS in your project

Use NPM to add `@microsoft/atlas-css` to your project.

```sh
# install with NPM
npm install --save @microsoft/atlas-css
```

You may access any file within the `/css` folder using the following UNPKG url. Just add the path to the file, relative to the `@` sign or version the end.

```sh
https://unpkg.com/browse/@microsoft/atlas-css/ # Will redirect to latest version
https://unpkg.com/browse/@microsoft/atlas-css@<version>/ # Use this pattern on your page
```

### Install Atlas JS in your project

Behaviors and elements beyond the scope of CSS are found in the `/js` folder.

```sh
# install with NPM
npm install --save @microsoft/atlas-js
```
